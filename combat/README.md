This project is one of the freest project of your first year. Create your own RPG.
Your main challenge for this game will be to create a complete product using everything that you and your team know.
To give the users the feeling that you’re delivering a complete product you need to polish as much as possible your game.
Your game must follow the following rules:
- Having a pleasant user interface.
- Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, . . . )
- Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal.
- Create a game with a beginning and an end.
